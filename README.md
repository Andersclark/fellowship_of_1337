# fellowship_of_1337

This is a project written by me, Anders Clark, in the midst of a raging pandemic in the hopes of finding a safe haven at his long-term dream employer tretton37.
The task was to rebuild [tretton37.com/meet](https://tretton37.com/meet).

##### My goal has been to:
* Write fairly clean code, even though I'm pressed for time.
* Set up a project that would be easy to clone, run and deploy.
* Not have any dependencies on UI-frameworks.
* Build an esthetically clean site.
* Support Chrome, Firefox and Edge.
* Make the entire product responsive and working on all screen sizes.
* Implement some non-disturbing animations.
* Add sorting and filtering to UI.
 

## How to start

##### Run this command in terminal:
`git clone https://github.com/Andersclark/fellowship_of_1337.git && cd fellowship_of_1337 && yarn install && yarn start`

(*requires [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)*)

## Available Scripts

### `yarn lint`

Runs Eslint with AirBnB-rules, reporting results in terminal.

### `yarn lint:fix`

Runs Eslint with AirBnB-rules, attempting to automatically correct issues, then reporting results in terminal.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
